# Depths of Decay
GADS7321 POE
## About the Game
Depths of Decay is a serious game focused on raising awareness about Sustainable Development Goal 14: Life Below Water. Players take on the role of Sage Monroe, a marine biologist dedicated to restoring polluted ocean habitats. Navigating underwater zones with limited oxygen and tools, players remove debris and manage resources carefully to bring life back to fragile ecosystems.

The game balances thoughtful decision-making with immersive exploration, encouraging players to reflect on ocean pollution’s real-world impact while progressing through increasingly challenging environments.
## Project Background
This was a collaborative project designed around a social cause, where my partner and I chose to spotlight SDG 14 due to our shared passion for ocean conservation. After researching various NPOs, we partnered conceptually with *The Ocean Cleanup* to ensure the game aligned closely with their mission and brand values.

Our goal was to create meaningful gameplay that educates players while offering engaging mechanics and an authentic underwater atmosphere.

## My Role and Contributions
- **Coding**: Developed core gameplay mechanics including player controls, resource management, and a modular inventory system built with Scriptable Objects - a challenging but rewarding experience as it was my first time implementing such a system.
- **UI Design**: Created all user interface elements using Photoshop, and designed a clickable Figma prototype during the early design phase to test and refine user experience.
- **Animation**: Assisted in animating the main character’s underwater movements, learning key 2D sprite animation techniques.
- **Visual Effects**: Learned to implement a parallax background effect in Unity to add depth and reduce visual rigidity in the game environment.
- **Tile Maps**: Gained experience creating tile-based maps in Unity, allowing for modular and scalable level design.

My partner focused on producing all art assets and collaborated on shaping the overall game concept.
## Design Decisions and Learnings
- **Environmental Focus**: Anchoring the game around The Ocean Cleanup gave a clear mission-driven narrative and helped ground gameplay in real-world conservation efforts.
- **Resource Management Gameplay**: Oxygen limits and debris weight mechanics encourage strategic thinking, emphasising the delicate balance marine biologists face.
- **Parallax Backgrounds**: Adding layered scrolling backgrounds increased immersion and visual interest, teaching me how subtle effects can greatly enhance player engagement.
- **Modular Inventory System**: Using Scriptable Objects made the inventory flexible and scalable, preparing me for more complex systems in future projects.

The biggest technical challenge was designing and coding the inventory system, which pushed me to learn new Unity scripting concepts and debug complex data handling.
## Tools and Technologies
- **Engine**: Unity
- **Modeling**: 2D Tile Maps
- **Animation**: Unity 2D Sprite Animator
- **UI Design**: Photoshop & Figma (prototyping)
- **Programming**: C# scripting with Scriptable Objects
## What I Learned
- How to integrate environmental themes and real-world issues into engaging game mechanics.
- Practical experience with 2D game development, including tile maps and sprite animation.
- The importance of prototyping UI with tools like Figma to iterate on design before full implementation.
- Implementing modular systems in Unity that allow for flexible game features and future scalability.
- Collaboration and division of work in a team setting, balancing design and development tasks.
## Future Improvements
- Expand inventory functionality with more items, upgrades, and interactivity.
- Add more varied enemy and environmental hazards to increase gameplay challenge.
- Further optimise parallax and visual effects to enrich atmosphere without impacting performance.
- Incorporate more educational content to deepen player understanding of ocean conservation.
