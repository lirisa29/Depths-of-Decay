    dialogueText: Hey, Pieter. It's good to finally meet you in person.
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: be2ce026c2371184e8c217126703e60d, type: 2}
    dialogueText: "Ah, you must be Sage. I\u2019ve heard a lot about you. I\u2019m
      glad you\u2019re here. We need all the help we can get."
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 087db4211aca13a468d3461462612ddc, type: 2}
    dialogueText: "I\u2019ve been reading up on the Vaal\u2026 I didn\u2019t realize
      how bad things had gotten here. It\u2019s heartbreaking."
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: be2ce026c2371184e8c217126703e60d, type: 2}
    dialogueText: "Yeah. Once, this river was the lifeblood of our community. People
      used to fish, swim, drink from it. Now, it\u2019s toxic. We\u2019re toxic."
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: be2ce026c2371184e8c217126703e60d, type: 2}
    dialogueText: "The air smells of chemicals, the water\u2019s full of waste, and
      people get sick from just living here. But the government\u2026 they don\u2019t
      listen. They\u2019ve been ignoring it for years."
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 087db4211aca13a468d3461462612ddc, type: 2}
    dialogueText: "That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to change, right? We can\u2019t
      do everything, but we can clean what we can and show people what\u2019s possible."
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 087db4211aca13a468d3461462612ddc, type: 2}
    dialogueText: "It\u2019s going to take more than just cleaning up, though, isn\u2019t
      it?"
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: be2ce026c2371184e8c217126703e60d, type: 2}
    dialogueText: "Yeah. The cleanup\u2019s just one piece of the puzzle. We need
      better infrastructure, proper waste management\u2026 but until we get the government
      to step up, it\u2019s on people like you and me to do what we can."
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: be2ce026c2371184e8c217126703e60d, type: 2}
    dialogueText: "We can\u2019t do this alone. We need to make noise. We need people
      to care."
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 087db4211aca13a468d3461462612ddc, type: 2}

  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: be2ce026c2371184e8c217126703e60d, type: 2}
    dialogueText: "I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here, Sage. I think you\u2019re just
      the person to help us make that noise."
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 087db4211aca13a468d3461462612ddc, type: 2}
    dialogueText: "Let\u2019s get started then. There\u2019s a lot of work ahead."
