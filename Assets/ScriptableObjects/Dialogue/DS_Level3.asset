    dialogueText: "Hey! You must be Sage! I\u2019ve heard so much about you!"
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: c165e7b3d81b7c448b8dffc3641ca6de, type: 2}
    dialogueText: "I\u2019m Kiara. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here to help with
      the reef."
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 087db4211aca13a468d3461462612ddc, type: 2}
    dialogueText: "Thanks, Kiara. It\u2019s good to be here. I\u2019ve been reading
      up on the reef, and it sounds like it\u2019s in rough shape."
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: c165e7b3d81b7c448b8dffc3641ca6de, type: 2}
    dialogueText: "Yeah, it\u2019s... it\u2019s tough. False Bay used to be my escape,
      you know? When I dive, it felt like I could breathe underwater, like I was
      part of another world. The colors, the life, the reefs were just alive."
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: c165e7b3d81b7c448b8dffc3641ca6de, type: 2}
    dialogueText: "But now\u2026 it\u2019s different. The trash, the bleaching, the
      silence where there used to be buzzing corals... it feels like I\u2019m diving
      into a memory, not a living place."
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 087db4211aca13a468d3461462612ddc, type: 2}
    dialogueText: I can imagine how heartbreaking that must be, to watch something
      so beautiful slip away.
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: c165e7b3d81b7c448b8dffc3641ca6de, type: 2}
    dialogueText: "It is. But the thing is, I can still feel the potential down there.
      The reef\u2014it\u2019s not gone, not completely. It\u2019s just sick. If we
      act fast enough, we can help it heal. I truly believe that."
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: c165e7b3d81b7c448b8dffc3641ca6de, type: 2}
    dialogueText: "I\u2019m here to dive, to photograph, to raise awareness. Small
      acts, you know? It might not seem like much, but if we all pitch in, maybe
      we can turn things around."
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 087db4211aca13a468d3461462612ddc, type: 2}
    dialogueText: "I like that. You\u2019re right it\u2019s the small acts that can
      build momentum. Every cleanup, every piece of plastic removed, every story
      shared, it adds up."
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: c165e7b3d81b7c448b8dffc3641ca6de, type: 2}
    dialogueText: "Exactly. And maybe, just maybe, when we dive in and see the reef,
      we\u2019ll remind it of what it can be again. Maybe it\u2019ll start to remember
      how to heal."
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 087db4211aca13a468d3461462612ddc, type: 2}
    dialogueText: "I think you\u2019re onto something. It\u2019s going to take all
      of us working together scientists, divers, locals\u2026 everyone."
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: c165e7b3d81b7c448b8dffc3641ca6de, type: 2}
    dialogueText: "Exactly! And with you here, I know we\u2019re going to make a
      difference."
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: c165e7b3d81b7c448b8dffc3641ca6de, type: 2}
    dialogueText: Ready to dive in?
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 087db4211aca13a468d3461462612ddc, type: 2}
    dialogueText: "Absolutely. Let\u2019s see what we can do."
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: c165e7b3d81b7c448b8dffc3641ca6de, type: 2}
    dialogueText: "Alright then! Let\u2019s show the reef we haven\u2019t forgotten
      it."
